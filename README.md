This is a [React JS](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Run locally in development mode

Fist, get the "github-repositories-explorer" repository from github :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryudha001/github-repositories-explorer.git
```

Once the repository has been cloned successfully, then head to github-repositories-explorer project directory :

```bash
cd github-repositories-explorer
```

Then, install the libraries listed in package.json :

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Once the libraries are successfully installed, then run the development server :

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

Once the development server is running, then :

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
